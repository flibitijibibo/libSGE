This is a list of important changes in SGE's version history.

010517:
- Abs of unsigned values bug fixed.
- Include SDL path fixed.
- using namespace std removed.

030809:
-Better Makefiles (autodetects SDL, Freetype & SDL_Image).
-Better library numbering (thanks Sam!).
-Fixed a problem with newer version of g++ and c-linkage.
-Better C support (thanks Ippei!). 
 SGE is now configured to support C and C++ with the same 
 library file (set C_COMP=n in Makefile.conf to disable).
-Resynced the TTF code with SDL_ttf 2.0.6 (.fon and stream support).
-Added filled and gourand shaded polygons.
-Removed some harmless warning with MS Visual C++.
-Added multicolored lines.
-Cleaned up the text input functions (the return value has changed a bit).
-Fixed some bitmap rendering bugs in sge_Text.
-Some minor updates and bugfixes.
 

020904:
-Corrected some errors in the documentation.
-Fixed problems with Visual C++.
-Fixed line clipping.
-Resynced the TTF code with SDL_ttf 2.0.5, some functions added.
-Fixed alpha levels with the TTF renderer (thanks Marco!).
-Fixed small error in rotate clipping logic. 


020104:
-Added sge_FloodFill(), a fast non-recursive flood fill function.
-Fixed a problem with the example 'speedtest' with gcc v3.
-Some portability fixes.
-Some small changes to the makefiles.
-Added a "Beginners guide to SGE" to the documentation.
-Added anti-aliased ellipses and circles.
-Better alpha blending in AA lines.
-Fixed a problem when AA rotating 32bit surfaces.


010629:
-Many, many optimizations.
-Split sge_draw into sge_surface and sge_primitives.
-Fixed some bugs with hardware surfaces.
-Fixed bugs with 24 bpp.
-Added sge_PutPixelAlpha() - put pixel with blending.
-Most drawing primitives now have an 'Alpha' version too.
-Added anti-aliased lines (from SDL_gfxPrimitives).
-Added anti-aliased bezier curves.
-Added anti-aliased triangles.
-Texture mapped rotation/scaling is back! It's a bit faster than normal
 rotation but not as nice and it can't do interpolation. Use the flag 
 'SGE_TTMAP' to select this renderer with sge_transform().
-A new example is included: 'speedtest', benchmarks most of SGEs 
 primitives. Inspired by the example from SDL_gfxPrimitives.
-Synced the TTF code with SDL_ttf 2.0.3; SGE now uses FreeType 2!
 Changed the makefile to use the new freetype-config tool.
 Note that FreeType2 can load more font formats than just truetype.


010606:
-Small fix in sge_draw.h.
-Fixed sge_Lock_ON(). Added sge_getUpdate() & sge_getLock() to get the 
 current mode. 
-Fixed a signed-cast in sge_tt_text.cpp. 
-New rotation/scaling engine! Much faster and can do interpolated
 rendering. Use sge_transform()/sge_transform_surface() to access the new 
 features. See documentation for more info. 


010224:
-Fixed errors with SDL_VERSIONNUM for older versions of SDL.
-Synced the TTF code with SDL_ttf 1.2.2.
 New functions:
   sge_TTF_FontAscent() returns ascent
   sge_TTF_FontDescent() returns descent
   sge_TTF_FontLineSkip() returns recommended line skip
   sge_TTF_SetFontStyle() sets font style (SGE_TTF_NORMAL|SGE_TTF_BOLD|
     SGE_TTF_ITALIC|SGE_TTF_UNDERLINE)
   sge_TTF_GetFontStyle() returns the current style.
 Thanks to Idigoras Inaki (IIdigoras@ikerlan.es) for betatesting this!  
-Fixed more problems with MSVC. Should work now.
-Added sge_BF_TextSize().
-Exorcised the old and horrible sge_tt_input_object class! 
 New classes for text handling and rendering:
   sge_TextEditor  - edits textstrings
   sge_text        - render and buffers text
   sge_TextSurface - same as sge_surface (but with text)
   sge_TextSsprite - same as sge_ssprite (      "      )
   sge_TextSprite  - same as sge_sprite  (      "      ).
-Minor changes to the sge_shape classes (mostly bugfixes).
-Added border_warp() in sge_ssprite.
-New flag for sge_BF_OpenFont(): SGE_BFPALETTE. sge_BF_OpenFont() will
 use an 8bit surface for the font if this flag is set, this makes 
 sge_BF_SetColor() much faster (~O(1)), but makes bliting a bit slower.
-Replaced font.bmp with a new font from Garrett Banuk's SDL Console
 (http://www.wpi.edu/~mongoose/SDL_Console).
-Better Makefile ('install' is possible now).
-Added sge_Bezier(), draws a bezier curve.
-Updated documentation.


010101:
-Clipping now also works in newer versions of SDL, but stay away from SDL 1.1.5!
-Fix for MDK7.2 include error.
-Some fixes for RedHat7 (the infamous gcc 2.96) from Chuck (clc@alum.mit.edu). 
-Cleaned up the makefiles, everything is now configured in Makefile.conf.
-Some fixes for MS VisC/C++ from Seung Chan Lim (limsc@maya.com or slim@djslim.com).
-Updated SFont support.


000930:
-This is a hack to get SGE working with SDL 1.1.5. When using the new version of
SDL SGE will not perform pixel clipping (for now). The "Big Alpha Flip" in SDL 
also changes how SGE handles alpha!!! SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE and SDL_ALPHA_TRANSPARENT
is always set to the correct values (even under old versions of SDL).
* THIS VERSION OF SGE IS NOT WELL TESTED! * Use SGE000714 if you don't have SDL
1.1.5 and don't feel lucky (this version of SGE should work with older versions of
SDL - I think...). The documentation is not yet updated. I think you need a new 
version of SDL_img if you want SFont support.
	

000714:
-Improved performance in sge_HLine().
-Changed all Sint32 coords to Sint16 (SDL uses Sint16).
-Added delay functions: sge_CalibrateDelay() and sge_Delay() [sge_misc].
-Johan E. Thélin has contributed a new part to SGE: [sge_blib] (Tadaa!).
-Nuked the old sge_sprite class and did it better this time [sge_shape].
-A new class: sge_screen, a tool class when working with shapes [sge_shape].
-sge_CalcYPitch() and sge_pPutPixel() added. Used for precalculating the y pitch
 offset [sge_draw].
-Some new routines for rotating and scaling bitmaps [sge_rotation].
-Updated and added some examples.
-Updated documentation.


000418:
-Improved the makefiles.
  * Always link your code against libSGE.a or libSGE.so *
-Fixed freetype.h include problem.
-Added sge.h - use it instead of the sge_*.h files.
-Separated the TT and bitmap code.
-Added some alpha component support:
 -sge_CreateAlphaSurface()
  Creates a 32bit alpha surface (RGBA - 8/8/8/8). The alpha channel is
	blended on blitting. *SGE only supports 32bit alpha surfaces*
 -sge_MapAlpha()
  Use this function to map Uint32 color values (RGBA) for alpha surfaces. 
	The color value can then be used with any of SGEs functions.
 -The TTF functions now support alpha blending. Use sge_TTF_AA_Alpha() to
  turn this feature on.
 -sge_AlphaFader()
  Fades from (sR,sG,sB,sA) to (dR,dG,dB,dA).
-Added SFont (Karl Bartel's font format) support to the bitmapfont routines.
 Open the sfont with sge_BF_OpenFont("filename",SGE_BFSFONT). Note that most
 sfonts need a alpha channel to look good which means it can't be loaded as
 a .bmp file (they do not support alpha). To enable SGE to load .png files
 uncomment 'USE_IMG = y' in the makefile (requires the SDL_img library!),
 this will enable SGE to load any image format SDL_img supports. If you do
 this, remember to link your code with SDL_img (not necessary if you use 
 libSGE.so). 


000312:
-Fixed a bug in sge_Line().
-Added (still testing, no documentation) collision routines.
-More work on the sprite class.


000115:
-Added this text file.
-The TTF routines can now draw non anti-aliased text also. Control this with
 sge_TTF_AAOff() - Turns anti-aliasing OFF
 sge_TTF_AAOn()  - Turns anti-aliasing ON -DEFAULT-
-A new flagsystem (finally). The following routines are effected:
   sge_tt_input... - 'int type' replaced by 'Uint8 flags'
   sge_BF_OpenFont - 'int flags' replaced by 'Uint8 flags' (no API change)
   sge_BF_input    - 'Uint8 flags' added  *PLEASE UPDATE YOUR SOURCE*
 The following flags can be used: SGE_FLAG1 - SGE_FLAG8 (defined in sge_draw.h), but
 routine specific flags are also provided. The flags can be ORed, eg. 
 SGE_FLAG1|SGE_FLAG2|...
 The input functions has the following flags:
   SGE_IBG   - Preserve background (only in tt, BF always preserves the background)
   SGE_IDEL  - Delete text when finished
   SGE_INOKR - No keyrepeat
 NOTE! sge_tt_input: The old ('type') and the new ('flags') flags are not the same!
 If you do not update your source code, this will happend:
   type=0 => flags=0 - OK, same
   type=1 => flags=SGE_IBG - OK, same
   type=2 => flags=SGE_IDEL - NOT THE SAME! (should be SGE_IBG|SGE_IDEL)
-TrueType font support optional, check the README.


000102: 
SGE now supports win32 crosscompiling. Support for bitmap fonts added. Some printf() 
like functions added.


991222: 
Fixed a small bug in sge_UpdateRect, more work on the circle routines. SGE can now 
be linked to both C and C++ code, check the README file for more information.


991219: 
Fixes some problems with lines and adds some ellipse routines. Update: Oops, the 
sge_FilledEllipse function was missing - fixed.


991208: 
SGE now has a sprite class *VERY BETA* and a nice surface rotation function. This 
version is tested with SDL 0.10 and 1.0.


990905: 
New version, with a completed text edit class.


990827: 
Released a new version, now with documentation.


990826: 
First public release of SGE (r990826). Have fun!
